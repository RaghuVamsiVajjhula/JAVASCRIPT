 Whenver we visit an html page so it contains many html elements in it.
If we want to manipulate the html elements with javascript we need to use DOM.
For example:
We see HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT on a nav bar of a  website and assume we see the
text in blue color now if we want to change one of them into red or someother color we can use js.

Syntax:
document.getElementsByClassName("class name here").style.color="red";


It refers to HTML page where all nodes are objects.There are mainly 3 nodes in DOM tree:
1.Text nodes
2.Element nodes
3.Comment nodes

In an html page <html> is at the root and <head> and <body> are its children and these children further
consists their children.
A text node is always a leaf of the tree.


AUTOCORRECTION:
If there is an error in html the browser tends to correct it.

For example if you open a span tag and gave some statement ended it with div tag.
So the browser automatically ends it with span tag at the end of body and it will ignore
the ending of div tag.

Another example where we have tbody tag under the table element.If you dont insert tbody so
by default it is automatically added into it by the browser.



On using document.head we get the head element of the html
On also document.documentElement gives us all the elements present inside code.
On using document.title we get the title of the webpage which is written in HTML.

typeof document.title returns the type if the title
Example for the website: codewithharry.com the title is given as Learn to code online for free.

So,
typeof document.title returns the value string.
typeof document.documentElement returns the value object as the document element is an 
object created to an html page.


Note: the document.body returns null if the javascript is written before the body tag in html.
as the document.body returns the value after completion of body element if you place it before 
the body tag it cant determine the body tag.

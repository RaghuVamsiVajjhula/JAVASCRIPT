The above mentioned is the syntax of declaring a variable in java script.
Further the types of declarations are as below:

let x=30;
The value of the variable x can be changed in future.

const y=99;
The value of variable y cannot be changed in future.The variable cannot be 
reassigned with some other value again.

DATA TYPES:
There are several data types like:
Numbers(10,3.4)
String("Hello",'Hi')
Boolean(true,false)
Array([1,2,3])
objects({name:"Ash",age:19})

data type of a variable when you declare it!

A variable can store values like sum of 2 other variables.
